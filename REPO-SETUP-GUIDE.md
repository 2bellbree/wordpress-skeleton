## Setting up branch protection rules

Branch protection rules should be added to the main branches of the project. It is also necessary to add branch protection rules when adding branch delete mechanism by default as described below, so that these default and main branches are not deleted. 

A good startpoint is to protect `master`, `staging`, `develop`, `qa`, `testing`.
Any branch other than protected branch should be created according to branch naming guidelines given in project readme.

## Setting up of deletion of merged branches

Branches other than protected branches should be removed as soon as their work is done. To setup automatic deletion of branches when they are merged go through the below guide. Please make sure to protect branches before setting this up. Otherwise it can lead to deletion of required branches.
