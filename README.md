## Customize the actions

[GitHub actions library](https://github.com/rtCamp/github-actions-library) have the flexibility of customization to accomodate various scenarios.

To customize any particular file in the action, follow the folder structure of the library inside `.github` folder. File inside `.github` folder will override the default file in the action.

Example: If `deploy.php` needs to be customised, then in the library the file is present in `deploy` folder. So, placing it in location `.github/deploy/deploy.php` will override the one in action.
